                            <dt>How does NoBin work?</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>A random key is generated and used to encrypt the paste, thanks to the
                                    <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/">sjcl</a>
                                    JavaScript library.</p>
                                <p>The encrypted content is then sent to the server, which returns the address of the newly created paste.</p>
                                <p>The JavaScript code redirects to this address, but it adds the encryption key in the URL hash (#).</p>
                                <p>When somebody wants to read the paste, they will usually click on a link with this URL. If the hash containing the key is a part of it, NoBin's JavaScript will use it to decrypt the content sent by the server.</p>
                                <p>The browser never sends the hash to the server, so the latter does not receives the key at any time.</p>
                            </dd>
                            <dt>But JavaScript encryption is not secure!</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>No, it isn't.</p>
                                <p>The goal of NoBin is
                                    <strong>not</strong>
                                    to protect the user and their data (including, obviously, their secrets).</p>
                                <p>Instead, it aims to protect the host from being sued for the content users pasted on the pastebin. The idea is that you cannot require somebody to moderate something they cannot read - as such, the host is granted plausible deniability.</p>

                                <p>Remember that as an user, you should use NoBin in the same way as unencrypted and insecure pastebins - that is, with caution. The only difference with those is that if you decide to host a NoBin server, the encryption feature hopefully be used as a
                                    defense. This is not proven, though! :-)

                                </dd>
                                <dt>What if the server changes the JavaScript code? And what happens in the case of a
                                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MITM attack</a>?</dt>

                                    <p>Read above.</p>
                                    <p>NoBin is not built, and does not aim, to protect user data - but rather the host. If any user data is compromised, NoBin still provides the host with plausible deniability (as they ignore the content of the pastes).</p>
                                    <p>It would make no sense if the host was to compromise the encryption process to read the data; in that case, they wouldn't have installed NoBin in the first place, as NoBin is here to protect them.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>However, if you want to ensure your data is not read in anyway, you should not use NoBin</strong>. Use
